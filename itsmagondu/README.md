# Count Zeros
This application takes a list of numbers and counts how many zeros are in the list. It also throws an error if any other data structure is passed except a list


## Requirements
 - Python 3

## Testing
 - run `python3 test_count_zeros.py`

 The test script should run two tests. One with valid data (a list) and another with invalid data (a string)
